**Recon-ng**

**What it is:** A Python-based tool for gathering public information (OSINT).

**The Interface:** Built to look and feel like Metasploit, making it easy for security pros to use.

**The Goal:** It automates the "busy work" of searching the web, APIs, and databases.

**The Benefit: **It centralizes all your findings into one searchable database, saving hours of manual research.
