## Task 1: Reconnaissance Tools in Kali Linux

This assignment demonstrates the use of:
- Recon-ng
- Nmap
- Hping3
- DNSRecon


**Recon-ng**

**What it is**: A Python-based tool for gathering public information (OSINT).

**The Interface**: Built to look and feel like Metasploit, making it easy for security pros to use.

**The Goal**: It automates the "busy work" of searching the web, APIs, and databases.

**The Benefit**:It centralizes all your findings into one searchable database, saving hours of manual research.

**Launch**: Type recon-ng in the Kali Linux terminal to enter the interactive shell.

**Red Warnings**: These indicate missing API keys for specific services (like Shodan or Google).

**Functionality**: The tool is still fully usable; you just can't use the specific modules that require those missing credentials.

**Next Step**: You can usually start with "passive" modules that scrape public data without needing any keys at all.

**The Welcome**: When you launch, you'll see ASCII art and a summary of all available modules.

**Module Categories**: The tools are organized into three main types:

**Recon**: For gathering data.

**Reporting**: For exporting your findings.

**Discovery**: For interacting with the target directly.

**Customization**: The modular setup means you only load the specific scripts you need for your current target, keeping things clean and efficient.
